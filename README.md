# Symphony : yet another open source personal game engine

Symphony is a FUCKIN SICK GAME ENGINE (well for me) that can do cool stuff and will do a lot of cool stuff when I have the energy to work on it 

## Current stuff it can do

- Some basic rendering (Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX)
- Window abstraction with SDL
- Plugin loading with Win32 DLLs
- GLSL, SPIRV and HLSL shaders (Vertex shaders and Pixel Shaders, no geometry shader for now)

## Stuff I want to implement

- So much stuff and I'm really lazy to list them all
- Make this repo more professionnal lmao
