# Symphony : yet another open source personal game engine

Right now Symphony is just a neat prototype I'm developping to learn how Vulkan and DX11 works, but yo it's gonna be sick in a few months

## Current stuff it can do

- Some basic rendering (Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX)
- Window abstraction with SDL
- Plugin loading with Win32 DLLs
- GLSL, SPIRV and HLSL shaders

## Stuff I want to implement

- So much stuff and I'm really lazy to list them all
- Make this repo more professionnal lmao
